			Allows construction of Nano Repair Units which slowly consume power and fuel to repair apparel and weapons.
			Units:
			- Beds
			+ (single, double, hospital) - repair equipped apparel / weapons
			while you sleep in them.
			- Shelves
			+ (2x1, 1x1) - repair apparel / weapons stored on them.
			+ includes 1x1 regular shelf in addition to the 1x1 nano shelf, not
			sure why there isn't one already in the base game

			Info:
			- The rate at which repair work is done is determined by the quality of the
			nano unit. and is displayed in the info section.
			- Units that are powered off still do their base functionality
			(ie you can still sleep in beds, and store things on shelves
			that are not powered/fueled)
			- When not actively repairing anything, nano units automatically
			go into low power consumption mode.
			- Fuel is consumed at a relatively slow rate. 1 Fuel heals 4 HP.
			During my testing around 1 fill up per year.
			- Fuel is initially created at the machining bench, and with
			further research at the refinery.
			- Shelves repair at the same rate over 24 hours as beds do for 8 hours.
			i.e. if you sleep all night with a duster on, the amount of repair done
			to it by a bed would have been the same as if it had been on a shelf all day
			- Shelves are particularly useful by a stockpile. Set the allowed HP range
			from 0-99 and pawns will automatically take items off the shelf when they
			are fully repaired, and put something else on that needs repaired.

			Research:
			Nano Repair Tech (basic tech):
			This research allows construction of Nano Repair Units (beds / shelves).
			These basic units will repair apparel only.

			Apparel Breakdown:
			Break down apparel (tainted and/or non-tainted), at the biofuel refinery
			into base Nano Tech chemicals. This break down process is very desctructive
			and the majority of useful chemicals is destroyed.

			Nano Tech Refining:
			Refine base Nano Tech chemicals with small amounts of textile or
			leather into Nano Tech Fuel. This process requires chemfuel as a catalyst.

			Nanite Extender Arm (weapons tech):
			Alter the nanites used in nano tech units to incorporate an extender arm.
			This modification, with an increased power requirement, makes it possible to repair
			weaponry in addition to apparel.

			Power Shielding (advanced tech):
			Further alter the nanites used in nano tech units to greatly increase their
			electric shielding. This lets the nanites operate at higher wattages, increasing
			and repair rate for apparel and greatly increasing their rate for weapons.

			Changes for v1.0:
			- The advanced tech no longer requires an entire new set of units to be made,
			the upgrades are applied to the units after the research is complete. I did
			this because with an advanced teir, it felt like a waste of resources to build
			the lower teir. With this change the nano tech units are useful as soon
			as they are researched, and more research will make them better without
			having to deconstruct/replace them.
			- Renamed (Bending Beds -> Nano Repair Tech)
			- The electricity only repair seemed too cheaty for a lot of people, even
			with the slow repair rate. With the added fuel requirement it
			feels much more balanced.
			- Added shelves
			- Patched bulk traders so that buy/sell nano tech fuel. It's market worth 
			is roughly that of wool, which isn't very much, but depending on how much 
			you get raided, you could end up with a lot of it via Apparel Breakdown 
			research from dead raiders apparel.
