		<description>Beds that consume power to slowly mend equipped clothing/apparel and repair weapons while you sleep.
		
Required research:
 - Beds
 - MicroElectronics Basics
 - Mending Beds Basic
 - Mending Beds (Weapons) -> Existing and new Mending Beds will now also
   repair equipped weapons
 - Mending Beds (Advanced) -> Allows construction of adv. mending beds, these beds can
   be constructed by a skilled constructor; they are more comfortable and repair apparel
   at an increased rate, and weapons at a greatly increased rate. More power is needed 
   to power the bed and construction requirements include more components and small
   amounts of the rare metals gold and uranium.
 - Hospital Beds (for hospital version)
 
Info:
 - The rate at which mending / repair work is done is determined by the quality 
   of the bed. And is displayed in the info section.
 - Beds that are not powered or toggled off, just become regular 
   beds ( i.e. you can still sleep in them ).
 - When a bed does not have an occupant in it that has equipment that needs 
   repair, it automatically switches to low power mode.
